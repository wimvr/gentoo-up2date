### DOWNLOAD ###

This package can be downloaded from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/gentoo-up2date/files/

### INSTALL ###

Unpack the archive, and copy up2date* to /usr/bin/. In case your machine is not
always turned on, and you are using anacrontab, add the following lines to
/etc/anacrontab:

1	30	dailyu2d	/usr/bin/up2date.daily
7	50	weeklyu2d	/usr/bin/up2date.weekly

In case your machine is always turned on, and you are using 'normal' cron, add
the following line to /etc/crontab:

55 1 * * *	root	/usr/bin/up2date

### DEINSTALL ###

Undo the above.

### STRUCTURE ###

The script first does a sync of the portage tree, and afterwards checks for
security updates. Afterwards it will check if it is Saturday, in that case
it will look up all pending updates on the system, and mail the overview, as
well as an easy to copy-paste list of all updates, new slots and rebuilds that
are pending. Last, it checks for new news items, and includes them in the mail
as well.
In case you use anacron, it will not mail all pending updates on Saturday, but
once every 7 days (or more if the machine is not running on the 7th day).
